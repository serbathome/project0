      Hi there! My name is Sergey and this is my first attempt to create a web site using HTML/CSS and bootstrap lib. I'm doing
      a Web Programming course with HarvardX at edx.org and hope to learn many new cool things. This site is not expected
      to be something very complex, so it would be mostly about myself and my hobbies.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my life I'm a happy father of 2 kids and proud husband of a very beatiful lady. I work for Microsoft and in the last few
      years mostly focused on professional services delivery management. Here is link to my
      <a href="cv.html">CV</a> and as well a link to my professional profile at
      <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergey-biryukov-97600825/">Linkedin</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apart from my work I have few hobbies. I like reading, but don't have enough time for it. I usually read while on vacaitions
      or long business trips (eg. on the plane going to or back from US). Another big hobby is the game of chess. Frankly
      speaking I'm not that good at chess, but I love the game very much. I was playing as a kid, same as everyone, but didn't
      make much progress. I started re-learning the game recently after I watched a movie about Bobby Fisher ("Pawn Sacrifice").
      Great movie and really worth watching even if you don't like the game itself. Now I'm learning Caro Cann defence for
      black and would publish
      <a href="chess.html">here</a>
      some interesting games and variations along with my latest wins for black.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have a question or any suggestions on this website please don't hesitate to contact me. I'm quite active on different
      social
      <a href="contact.html">networks</a>. Practically all of them :)
