	<h1>The game of chess</h1>
	<div class="intro">
		<p>
			Frankly speaking I'm not that good at chess, but I love the game very much.
			I was playing as a kid, same as everyone, but didn't make much progress. I started
			re-learning the game recently after I watched a move about Bobby Fisher. Great movie
			really woth watching it even if you don't like the game itself.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now I'm learning Caro Cann defence for black and would publish here some interesting
			games and variations along with my latest win for black.
